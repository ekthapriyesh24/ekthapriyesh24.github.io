        <p>I am Priyesh Raj.This page desribes my journey from my childhood till date</p>
        <p>My native place is Jamshedpur.I have done my schooling from Jamshedpur.I have studied from Motilal Nehru Public School till 10th class.I was a shy,introvert,not so intelligent boy in school.Yet I worked hard and used to be among the top 3 students in my class.Finally,my hard work paid off and I scored a whooping 96.8% in I.C.S.E examinations.</p>
        <p>From there I moved onto a new school-D.A.V Bistupur. I had to work very hard as I had to study for school as well as prepare for the JEE examinations.Although,I faced lot of hardships,my parents always helped me with the best they could so that I don't face any problems.Their sacrifices are too huge which I cannot even dream of paying back.It was due to their prayers and sacrifice and my hard work that I got a rank of 9775 in JEE and got admission in IIIT,Allahabad.</p>
        <p>I am currently pursuing my B.Tech in ECE from IIIT Allahabad,Prayagraj. Although I am in ECE branch ,I am keenly interested in competitive coding,making softwares. My first year at college was full of new experiences which I could not have gained while living in my home.Apart from studies the college has a very good environment for programming and is a boon for programmers.</p>
