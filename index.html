I am Priyesh Raj.
This page desribes my journey from my childhood till date
My native place is Jamshedpur.
I have done my schooling from Jamshedpur.
I have studied from Motilal Nehru Public School till 10th class.
I was a shy,introvert,not so intelligent boy in school.
Yet I worked hard and used to be among the top 3 students in my class.Finally,my hard work paid off and I scored a
whooping 96.8% in I.C.S.E examinations.
From there I moved onto a new school-D.A.V Bistupur. I had to work very hard as I had to study for school as well as
prepare for the JEE examinations.Although,I faced lot of hardships,my parents always helped me with the best they could
so that I don't face any problems.Their sacrifices are too huge which I cannot even dream of paying back.It was due to
their prayers and sacrifice and my hard work that I got a rank of 9775 in JEE and got admission in IIIT,Allahabad.I am
currently pursuing my B.Tech in ECE from IIIT Allahabad,Prayagraj. Although I am in ECE branch ,I am keenly interested
in competitive coding,making softwares. My first year at college was full of new experiences which I could not have
gained while living in my home.Apart from studies the college has a very good environment for programming and is a boon
for programmers.</div>
